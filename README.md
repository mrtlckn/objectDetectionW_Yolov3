# What is YOLOv3?
YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, Version 3) is a real-time object detection algorithm that identifies specific objects in videos, live feeds, or images. YOLO uses features learned by a deep convolutional neural network to detect an object. Versions 1-3 of YOLO were created by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi.

The first version of YOLO was created in 2016, and version 3, which is discussed extensively in this article, was made two years later in 2018. YOLOv3 is an improved version of YOLO and YOLOv2. YOLO is implemented using the Keras or OpenCV deep learning libraries.

# How does YOLOv3 work?
YOLO is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for performing object detection in real-time. YOLO has the advantage of being much faster than other networks and still maintains accuracy.
